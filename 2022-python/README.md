# Advent of Code 2022

Solutions to the puzzles from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

## How to run
The solutions are written in Python and can be run in Jupyter Notebook.
The included bash script can be used to install the required dependencies in a virtual environment and start the notebook server.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/romanpeters/advent-of-code
cd 2022-python
source ./aoc.sh init
./aoc.sh run 
```
The solutions themselves use no external dependencies and are tested with Python 3.10.

Alternatively, you can click on the Binder badge above to open a cloud-hosted version.
